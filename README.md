## Introduction
In this project we will analyze the used car dataset using the CRISP Data Modelling framework available in AIML and identify the features in the data set that leads to the increase or decrease of the car price. As a result of this analysis, we will be able to identify the features that consumers are looking for while purchasing a used car. This analysis could be used by the used car dealers to improve their inventory. 

## Overview
Python program we developed will go through the  below CRISP DM framework phases and 
 Business understanding : From the business perspective understand the key drivers of car prices.
 Data understanding : Explore the data set and look for any quality issues.
 Data preparation : Removal of NAN value rows and ensuring the features that needs to be type casted to integers as a prerequisite for modelling.
 Modelling : Create several regression models and train it with price as target.
 Evaluation :  Evaluate the model and validate the results
 Deployment : Once evaluation is satisfactory deploy the model.

## Deliverables 

We used following data set  (https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/practical_application_II_starter.zip) , create a model to study the features that are considered by customers.
A report will be created with the findings from the models we created along with the recommendations to the dealers.


## Conclusion
Used car dealers will review the reports created and make adjustments to the inventory accordingly.
